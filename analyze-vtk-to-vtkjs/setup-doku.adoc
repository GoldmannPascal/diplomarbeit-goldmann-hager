in this demo I try to embed a .vtk file into a small webapp with vtk.js

==== links
* https://github.com/Kitware/vtk-js/issues/668

you have to store the .vtk file in an ascii format bin not working

==== project set up

steps to set up and run the project

* npm install (install all node_modules)
* npm run start (starting the app at "localhost:8080")

==== problems and notes

the given .vtk from the blast furnace cant not be interpreted by vtkjs +
the problem is that *DATASET UNSTRUCTURED_GRID* is unhandled +

there is also another demo with a sphere +
the dataset of it is: *DATASET POLYDATA* +
the reason why he cant handle the first named dataset is, because there are also volumetric data in the file
